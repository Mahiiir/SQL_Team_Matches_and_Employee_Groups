# SQL Team Matches and Employee Groups

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries that solve two key problems:
1. Listing matches between teams where each match occurs only once.
2. Grouping employees into pairs and concatenating their details using SQL window functions.

These queries demonstrate techniques such as **permutations**, **window functions**, **string aggregation**, and the use of **NTILE** to divide data into groups.

## Problem 1: List All Matches Between Teams
### Query Description:
The goal of this query is to list all possible matches between teams, ensuring each match is listed only once.

---

## Problem 2: Group Employees into Sets
### Query Description:
The task is to group employees into pairs and concatenate their details using string aggregation and the NTILE window function.

---

## How to Run the Queries
1. Create the respective tables (match, emp) and insert the provided data.
2. Execute the queries in a PostgreSQL environment to see the results.
